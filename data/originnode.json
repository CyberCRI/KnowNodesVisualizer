  "bodyText":"For a decade Synthetic biology has tried to bring engineering approaches into classic molecular biology. Many hopes are now placed on this new field to tackle some of the challenges 21st century medicine is facing. In particular synthetic gene networks in human cells could revolutionize treatment strategy of a lot of diseases ranging from cancer to metabolic disorders. However this emerging field still needs to overcome legal, ethical and scientific difficulties before saving its first human life.",
